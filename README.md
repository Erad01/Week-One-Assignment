# Week-One-Assignment

Requirements Achieved:

I ensured each section of the webpage is wrapped in the correct semantic tags, ensuring that includes a <header>, <nav>, and <footer>.
I implemented CSS absolute positioning to overlay text on an image.
I utilised CSS Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive layout, particularly in the <nav> element.
I ensured all image elements (<img>) are correctly implemented with accurate src file paths

I created a “back to top” button.
I implemented smooth scrolling for internal links to improve user experience.
I implemented a hover effect on a button to make it more interactive.
I created a basic footer with social media icons that link to social media pages.
I added a background music track that plays automatically when the website loads.

Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve? No
If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks? N/A

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submissio:
I would love a feedback on the layout of my work. In the hindsight I just looked and I feel the colour combination may not be the best.

What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment?
I google some explanations of some things I intended to do and most times W3Schools was the website that presented a better explanation for me.

What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
While I was getting my images into my web page i could not see an image on my web page. After a long check i realised that the file name was not spelt correctly in my css file. After the correction the image came through.

What went really well and what could have gone better? The HTML part of my work went well. The CSS could have been better.
